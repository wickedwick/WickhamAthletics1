        <h4>"I began training with Ryan the spring of my freshman year. Immediately
         I noticed Ryan's determination and love for athletics. </h4>
    
        <p>During the summer before my sophomore year, I ended up tearing my right 
        anterior cruciate ligament at a football camp. I was disappointed but Ryan 
        assured me that he'd have me back faster and stronger than before. And that's
         exactly what he did. </p>
    
        <p>The physical therapy I did with Ryan helped 
        me to recover and still get stronger. Around the time I tore my ACL, I was 
        squatting around 335. A year later, I put nearly 100 pounds on my squat. Since 
        then, I've watched and experienced Wickham Athletics grow into an awesome 
        strength and athletic facility. Wickham Athletics and the people who train 
        there have changed my life. The people are all great and they all know quite 
        a bit about athletic training and the science behind it." </p>
